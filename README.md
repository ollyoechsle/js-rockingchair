#Glider Rocking Chair

I wanted to build a rocking chair in real life, but wanted to understand the effect of different variables on the motion of the eventual chair.

This is a very simple simulator which displays the motion of a rocking chair, allowing you to change various variables that affect its movement.

The UI is managed by KnockoutJS, and the simulation is rendered using canvas.

Here's a demo:
